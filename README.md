# Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphone Data

## Introduction
Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a popular research topic due to its wide applications in various fields such as healthcare, sports, and security. With the advancement of technology, smartphones, which are now an integral part of our lives, have become a useful tool for HAR. Equipped with sensors like accelerometers and gyroscopes, smartphones can be used to recognize human activities.

## What is Human Activity Recognition?
Human Activity Recognition is the process of identifying a person's actions based on certain observations. These observations can be derived from various sources such as video data, sensor data, and in this case, smartphone data.

## How does it work?
The basic idea behind HAR using smartphone data is quite straightforward. The accelerometer and gyroscope in your smartphone generate data based on the phone's movements. When you perform different activities like walking, running, sitting, standing, etc., your smartphone moves differently. These movements are captured by the sensors and used to recognize the activity.

## Machine Learning and HAR
Machine Learning plays a crucial role in HAR. The data generated by the sensors in the smartphone is fed into a machine learning model, which is trained to recognize different activities. The model learns from the sensor data and can predict the activity when new data is fed into it.
