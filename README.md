Introduction
Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has become a popular topic in research due to its wide range of applications in different fields such as health care, sports, and security. With the advancement of technology, smartphones have become an integral part of our lives. They are equipped with various sensors like accelerometers and gyroscopes, which can be used to recognize human activities.

What is Human Activity Recognition?
Human Activity Recognition is the process of identifying what a person is doing based on certain observations. These observations could be derived from various sources such as video data, sensor data, or in our case, smartphone data.

How does it work?
The basic idea behind HAR using smartphone data is quite simple. The accelerometer and gyroscope in your smartphone generate data based on the movements of the phone. When you are performing different activities like walking, running, sitting, standing, etc., your smartphone moves differently. These movements are captured by the sensors and used to recognize the activity.

Machine Learning and HAR
Machine Learning plays a crucial role in HAR. The data generated by the sensors in the smartphone is fed into a machine learning model, which is trained to recognize different activities. The model learns from the sensor data and can predict the activity when new data is fed into it.
